            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>If you ask me what I do, the answer will sound simple: I work with data. But look closer, and you’ll find someone quietly obsessed with uncovering the hidden patterns that shape our world - one dataset at a time.

With a background in operations and project coordination, I learned early that details matter - especially when they’re buried beneath deadlines, people, and noise. It was there, in the chaos of moving parts and crossed wires, that a quiet love for clarity took root. That clarity came from data.

Whether wrangling spreadsheets in Excel, querying insights with MySQL, or building intuitive dashboards in Tableau and Power BI, I don't just analyze data - I rediscover it. I believe each table tells a story. Some are about inefficiencies waiting to be corrected. Others are about people: their behaviors, their needs, their patterns left behind like breadcrumbs.

Using Python and a sharp analytical eye, I transform the complex into the comprehensible - not to impress, but to empower. My work is thoughtful, intentional, and always in service of answering the question: What’s really happening here, and what can we do about it?

Fueled by curiosity and grounded in purpose, I see data not as numbers, but as conversations. And each project, no matter the scale, is a chance to listen better, learn deeper, and help organizations move forward with confidence.</p>
